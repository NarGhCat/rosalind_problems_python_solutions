# rosalin problems python solutions
This is the repo of python solutions for the rosalin problems.  
You can find the problems [here](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/#)  
By doing this, I learn how to use python to tackle real bioinformatics problems.  
There are many exsiting libraries to solve the problems. In real-life bioinformatics, use well-established libraries as long as you can.
